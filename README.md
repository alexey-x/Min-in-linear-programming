# Min-in-linear-programming
min(x, y) - is not linear function but still can be used in linear programming.

Created this repository in order not to forget the equations.

The derivation is in the jupyter notebook min-function-upgrade.

The notebook min-function is not bad. It is first version. I keep it just for history.
